          <p>Energy Consumption
High Electricity Usage
Computers, particularly desktop models, consume a significant amount of electricity. Running computers, servers, data centers, and networks all require power. While laptops and mobile devices are generally more energy-efficient, large-scale systems (e.g., data centers that host websites or cloud services) contribute to significant energy consumption. And also,electricity comes from fossil fuels .

        <p>Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient Devices
 Designing computers with lower power consumption in mind can significantly reduce their environmental impact. Efficient processors, low-power components (like LED screens, energy-efficient power supplies, and processors), and power-saving modes can decrease the overall energy usage of devices.

Energy Star Certification:
 Encouraging the use of energy-efficient certifications like Energy Star can help ensure that computer devices consume less electricity during their usage phase, which is the most energy-intensive part of their lifecycle.

Efficient Power Management:
Implementing smarter power management systems in both hardware and software, such as automatically switching to low-power modes when idle, can reduce unnecessary energy consumption.</p>
