mining of earth raw metal

a computer needs noble metal  for the battery , cpu ...... Mining these materials can cause serious environmental damage, including:

water pollution 
 	Mining these process may let local water supplies with toxic chemicals like cyanide, mercury, and sulfuric acid, posing risks and cause to both wildlife and human populations.

soil degradation
Mining activities often cause soil erosion, reduced soil fertility, and the destruction of local ecosystems.

      <p>Manufacturing Practices

Sustainable Manufacturing Processes
We must changing to greener manufacturing techniques .This involves using cleaner energy sources (such as renewable energyâ€”solar, wind, etc.), reducing greenhouse gas emissions during production, and minimizing water use and waste generation.

Reducing Resource Consumption
we need to reduce use of raw materials and minimizing waste in the production process can reduce the overall environmental footprint. This includes reusing materials, reducing excess packaging, and employing sustainable resource extraction practices.</p>
